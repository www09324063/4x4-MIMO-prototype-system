# 4x4-MIMO-prototype-system
This web page provides a 4*4 MIMO prototyping system to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithms in practical wireless MIMO communications. 
The prototyping implements important features of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) physical layer, with third generation partnership project (3GPP) long-term evolution (LTE) time-division duplex (TDD)-like specifications.
